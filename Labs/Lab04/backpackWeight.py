# Q3 Suppose you are a treasure hunter exploring an ancient cave filled with
# valuable artifacts. You have a backpack with a limited weight capacity W,
# and you must decide which artifacts to take to maximize your total value.
# Each artifact has a weight wi (how heavy it is) and a value vi (how much
# gold itâ€™s worth). However, you cannot take a fraction of an artifact, i.e., you
# must take either the whole artifact or leave it behind. Your goal is to
# maximize the total value of your loot while staying within the weight limit
# of your backpack.
# Implement a brute force approach to try all possible subsets of artifacts.
# Measure execution time for different backpack capacities and artifacts
# values and weights shown in q3input.txt. Plot the results of execution time
# for different inputs and analyze how the execution time increases with the
# number of artifacts. For example, for the following input:
# 50
# 10 60
# 20 100
# 30 120
# 5 30
# 15 80
# The first line indicates the backpack's capacity, which is 60. Each
# subsequent line represents an artifact's weight and value. For example,
# artifact 1 has a weight of 10 and a value of 60. In total, there are 5 artifacts.
# The output will be:
# Maximum Value: 270
# Selected Items (weight, value): [(10, 60), (20, 100), (5, 30), (15, 80)]
# Total Weight Used: 50
# Execution Time: 0.00000 sec
